# Showcase
This repository demonstrates my approach to setting up a development environment, structuring infrastructure, and writing code and tests.

## Project Foundation & Setup

- I generate a project using Spring Initializr (last release version)
- I add Spring Boot DevTools for hot deployment (only this dependency is included for getting started)
- I choose Maven as the build tool (I prefer Maven for simplicity in small projects, but Iâ€™m also ready to use Gradle for better performance in complex projects)
